## Chapter 4: Normal linear models

### **Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:**  
### ** How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? **  
### **To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE.**  
*John Locke (1698)*
